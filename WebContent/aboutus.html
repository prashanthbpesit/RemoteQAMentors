     <!--  <p>The idea of Work from Home Part Time of Full Time is very interesting. Most <u style="font-weight: bold;">WORK FROM HOME concepts are SCAMS!</u> Either you have to do the pesky calling and selling or do MLM marketing and Sales. Seriously who wants to do that? An ideal work from home for Part time or Full time should be you work on your own, don&rsquo;t do any sales pitch and work on your time schedule and on something legit. Am very excited to show you EXACTLY that and prove to you that there is a way where you can do all of these and it is so awesomely easy to do so.  </p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s right time to introduce ourselves: My name is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Apurva Jain</span> & I am into IT since 8 years. Am also a Part time Freelancer <span style="font-weight: bold;">and been working from home since last 1.5 years!</span>  </p>
      <p>Basically, I started doing so well in freelancing that I started getting lot of people interested to learn this and to do this. So after lot of thought and research I designed a 6 week course that can enable anyone to do what I have been doing since last 1.5 years. It has a single aim &ndash; To give you everything you need to succeed in making Work from Home a reality and not some abstract concept. Let me be straight forward, even in this age of digitization, there are just extremely small percentage of people who are truly working from home and are their own boss!

So basically by this course we give you a chance to pick our brains and to copy our success template.  </p>
  	  <label style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">Q: So what is this all about? </label>
	  <p>There&rsquo;s a platform where you can <u style="font-weight: bold;">earn extra money by testing simple apps and websites.</u> It is extremely simple testing &ndash; Similar to how an end user would use an app or website, you test it and log in the defects you observe. Also there are step by step validation &ndash; Test cases that you execute and get paid for validating it.   </p> -->
