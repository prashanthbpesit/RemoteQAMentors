<p class="faqheader">Welcome to <span style="color: red;">RemoteQAMentors.com</span> Let me introduce Myself, </p>
 <p class="faqcontents">My name is Apurva Jain and I have been working from home since last 2 years! I am a Senior Mobile Tester by profession. Since last 2 years I am also working part time online to make a cool $2k - $3k every month by finding bugs in simple Mobile Apps. As I started doing well, lot of people including my friends wanted to learn how to do it. So after lot of thought, research and freelancing experience I designed a 6 week course (20 Hours course) that can enable you to do what am doing since last 2 years. It has a single aim &ndash; To give you everything you need to succeed in making Work from Home a reality. Let me be straight forward, even in this age of digitization, there are just extremely small percentage of people who are truly working from home and are their own boss! With god&apos;s grace, I have had a privilege of helping many people earn money online. Also, this program is backed by a 60 Day 100% Money Back Guarantee. If for any reason, you are not satisfied by this program or you don&apos;t see results within 60 days, you are entitled for a 100% Refund. So there is no risk on your end. </p>
