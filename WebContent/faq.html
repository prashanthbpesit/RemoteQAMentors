<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q1"/>
<label class="animate" for="q1">Q:I am non IT professional, can I still do it?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: YES. The actual testing is very simple as in testing basic apps and websites. The only thing you will need some time to master is reporting a bug properly – Taking videos, capturing logs and executing test cases properly. Our training will help you overcome all of it. In fact we know many Non IT friends doing great here.</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q2"/>
<label class="animate" for="q2">Q:I am an experienced QA Professional; do I still need to take the training?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: Mostly YES. It’s not that you can’t do this on your own but the learning curve, complex platform and just the initial overwhelm of understanding everything and putting in place will be too time consuming and frustrating. This training is specifically designed to address all these aspects. So it’s your own call. We have 8+ years’ experienced QA professionals who joined us as they knew about it but couldn’t figure it out properly.</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q3"/>
<label class="animate" for="q3">Q: Is this a QA methodologies or theory training?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: NO. This is not a full blown QA training as such. It is also not just theory training with dummy project. This is a very practical, straight forward and specific training to help you succeed in Freelancing on uTest or similar platforms. We could add QA training and make it more complex but it is not needed for what this course was designed for.</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q4"/>
<label class="animate" for="q4">Q: Will I get a JOB with this training?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: YES/NO/MAYBE. I really don’t have an answer for such a question. You may end up doing this Full time or land up in Contract work with uTest openings. The projects that you work on will give you a lot of exposure and learning. You can use that in interviews and talk about kind of projects you have been handling. This is also really great especially if you are starting with QA career.</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q5"/>
<label class="animate" for="q5">Q: Is there any certification for this course?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: NO. This is not a Certification course. This course is personally developed after working extensively for a year on uTest and also there is no way for us to certify anything. All we are offering here is our personal experience and mentorship to help you realize dream of working from home.</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q6"/>
<label class="animate" for="q6">Q: Is there any guarantee that I will get any projects??</label>
<p class="response animate">A: YES. There are lot of projects in US, Canada & UK. So there is no doubt that you will get a lot of projects if you follow the training and also assignments. We will refund you if you don’t get any projects. </p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q7"/>
<label class="animate" for="q7">Q: How much time will I need to get Projects?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: We have seen some of our first batch students get project in first three weeks of the course itself. But to be fair, you will need to give yourself 6-8 weeks to start seeing frequent projects. The frequency of projects depends on the quality of work.</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q8"/>
<label class="animate" for="q8">Q: Is there any bidding involved? I mean how they will give the projects?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: NO. There is no bidding here. They will send projects to every registered user, see if you are a potential candidate to be given more projects and they will send out invites to work on a project. They have their internal rating and statistics to judge your work.</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q9"/>
<label class="animate" for="q9">Q: What is the $499 fee for?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: It is for the training and mentorship. This fee is one time and it covers the course materials, Assignments evaluation and teaching all the tools & software needed to report a bug properly and execute test cases.</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q10"/>
<label class="animate" for="q10">Q: Do I have to compulsory pay?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: YES. First class is FREE. But to take complete course (5 classes) you have to pay. We are putting a lot of efforts in this course and also there is not much seriousness from either side if the course is FREE. It is minimal investment to keep both sides fair.</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q11"/>
<label class="animate" for="q11">Q: Is there any other hidden fees?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: NO. The tools we teach are mostly free or less than $10. Also, this course is about making money and not spending money! So, don’t worry, there will be no fees ever!</p>

<input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q12"/>
<label class="animate" for="q12">Q: I have been cheated before and am skeptical about Work from Home as most are scams. How can I trust you?</label>
<p class="response animate">A: 19 We have given all the screen shots, explanation, working links for 3 real articles on forum that you can read and verify. Also, we have made first class free. We will also refund the course fee if you don’t like it at any point of the course. You are 100% Risk Free in this course.
